 * (>) GREATER THAN: Evaluates if the first number is greater than the second number
 * (<) LESS THAN: Evaluates if the first number is less than the second number
 * (>=) GREATER THAN OR EQUALS: Evaluates if the first number is greater than the second number or equal
 * (<=) LESS THAN OR EQUALS:  Evaluates if the first number is less than the second number or equal
 * 
 * Math object functions:
 * Math.abs() : Gets the absolute value of the given number
 * Math.sqrt() : Gets the square root of a number
 * Math.trunc() : Removes the decimals from a number
 * Math.round() : Rounds a number
 * Math.floor() : Rounds a number to the previous int
 * Math.ceil() : Rounds a number to the next int
 * Math.max() : Used to get the max number of a list of numbers
 * Math.min() : Used to get the min number of a list of numbers
